<p>I am a Sydney based Data Scientist and the purpose of page is to showcase examples of my work. </p>

<h3>
<a name="supervised-learning" class="anchor" href="#supervised-learning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supervised Learning</h3>

<p>Most of the time when people talk of Machine Learning they are largely speaking of supervised learning. Supervised Learning is used when we have examples of the outcomes. It can be split into two general classes and it also contains many sub-specialities largely around dealing with particular types of data.</p>

<h4>
<a name="regression" class="anchor" href="#regression"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Regression</h4>

<p>Regression is used when we are interested in looking at numerical outcomes.</p>

<h4>
<a name="classification" class="anchor" href="#classification"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classification</h4>

<p>Classification is used when we the outcomes in questions are classes. So for example we might be interested in classifying customers based on if they are likely to leave a company or not. There are also classification tasks where its not an either/or type of classification. For example if we were classifying movies we might have some that fall into both the "Action" and the "Comedy" categories. This is known as multi-class classification.</p>

<h3>
<a name="unsupervised-learning" class="anchor" href="#unsupervised-learning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unsupervised Learning</h3>

<p>Unsupervised Learning is when you don't know explicitly what you are looking to predict. Probably the most common usage for unsupervised learning in commercial settings is Cluster Analysis of customers. Often before the analysis is begin the number of groups is unknown. By grouping customers businesses can then adjust their approach to the groups to maximise their profit.</p>

<a name="sub-categories" class="anchor" href="#sub-categories"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sub-categories</h2>

<h4>
<a name="images" class="anchor" href="#images"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Images</h4>

<p>Dealing with images requires special steps. In particular the extraction of features from images uses special techniques to find edges of images. This is a field where deep learning has shown great promise.</p>

<h4>
<a name="natural-language-processing" class="anchor" href="#natural-language-processing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Natural Language Processing</h4>

<p>Dealing with words requires special steps to take the words and create features. One of the most common approaches is to stem the words in question and to create bag of words often also looking at sequences of words (n-grams). This is another area where deep learning is starting to show great promise.</p>

<h4>
<a name="time-series" class="anchor" href="#time-series"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Time Series</h4>

<p>Time Series Analysis directly incorporates time. It aims to look for cyclical and seasonal adjustments that might be predictable. One area which has driven a lot of academic and commercial work in this area is Energy Usage Forecasting. Predicting the demand for electricity accurately makes a big impact on Energy companies abilities to profit.</p>

<h4>
<a name="geospatial-analysis" class="anchor" href="#geospatial-analysis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Geospatial Analysis</h4>

<p>Geospatial analysis covers everything from basic maps to statistical analysis incorporation spatial distance.</p>

<h4>
<a name="network-analysis" class="anchor" href="#network-analysis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Network Analysis</h4>

<p>Network analysis has become a widely used form of analysis due to the growth of social networks. There are other uses for network analysis however and many relationships can be modelled on graphs.</p>

<h3>
<a name="reinforcement-learning" class="anchor" href="#reinforcement-learning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reinforcement Learning</h3>

<p>Reinforcement Learning is a large field where computers attempt to learn from some ongoing interactions where the pay off structure is unknown. So rather then give the computer a group of examples it just starts to make decisions and keeps track of the feedback it receives. Recent work utilising Deep Learning Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have lead to programs that can learn to play Atari 2600 games. However the most common usage in commercial settings is utilising Multi-Arm Bandit Algorithms to maximise say click-through rate. Its advantage over the more common A/B Testing is that its dynamic, so it adjusts itself to how customers respond maximising the return during the experimental phase. It also has the ability to learn from changing conditions and adjust accordingly.</p>
