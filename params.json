{"name":"Stephen Oates","tagline":"Aspiring Data Scientist","body":"### Welcome to the homepage of Stephen Oates.\r\nI am a Sydney based Data Scientist and the purpose of page is to showcase examples of my work. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Supervised Learning\r\nMost of the time when people talk of Machine Learning they are largely speaking of supervised learning. Supervised Learning is used when we have examples of the outcomes. It can be split into two general classes and it also contains many sub-specialities largely around dealing with particular types of data.\r\n\r\n#### Regression\r\nRegression is used when we are interested in looking at numerical outcomes.\r\n\r\n#### Classification\r\nClassification is used when we the outcomes in questions are classes. So for example we might be interested in classifying customers based on if they are likely to leave a company or not. There are also classification tasks where its not an either/or type of classification. For example if we were classifying movies we might have some that fall into both the \"Action\" and the \"Comedy\" categories. This is known as multi-class classification.\r\n\r\n### Unsupervised Learning\r\nUnsupervised Learning is when you don't know explicitly what you are looking to predict. Probably the most common usage for unsupervised learning in commercial settings is Cluster Analysis of customers. Often before the analysis is begin the number of groups is unknown. By grouping customers businesses can then adjust their approach to the groups to maximise their profit.\r\n\r\n### Time Series\r\nTime Series Analysis directly incorporates time. It aims to look for cyclical and seasonal adjustments that might be predictable. One area which has driven a lot of academic and commercial work in this area is Energy Usage Forecasting. Predicting the demand for electricity accurately makes a big impact on Energy companies abilities to profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reinforcement Learning\r\nReinforcement Learning is a large field where computers attempt to learn from some ongoing interactions where the pay off structure is unknown. So rather then give the computer a group of examples it just starts to make decisions and keeps track of the feedback it receives. Recent work utilising Deep Learning Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have lead to programs that can learn to play Atari 2600 games. However the most common usage in commercial settings is utilising Multi-Arm Bandit Algorithms to maximise say click-through rate. Its advantage over the more common A/B Testing is that its dynamic, so it adjusts itself to how customers respond maximising the return during the experimental phase. It also has the ability to learn from changing conditions and adjust accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nIf you would like to contact me you may do so by contacting me at [LinkedIn](au.linkedin.com/pub/stephen-oates/28/552/628/).
